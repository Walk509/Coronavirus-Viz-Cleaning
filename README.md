Jupyter Notebooks to tidy data for analysis in Tableau.

Coronavirus by County Dashboard

My Coronavirus project has data from the following sources:
  USA FACTS - https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
    Confirmed Cases - updated on a daily basis
    Deaths - updated on a daily basis
    County Population - 2019 Census will not be update
  Kaiser Health News - https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/
    ICU Beds per County - Updated last on March 30th

As two of our files are updated on a regular basis I have created the USA Facts Jupyter notebook to tidy the data and save the files.
This allows me to update my dashboard in Tableau with minimum clicks.
